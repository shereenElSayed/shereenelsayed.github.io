          Lab: RaceLab with Prof. Chandra Krintz and Prof. Rich Wolski
          My research focus area is distributed systems and IOT. I worked in several projects:
          - [CSPOT](https://github.com/MAYHEM-Lab/cspot): It is a runtime system that amalgamates ``Serverless'' computing (i.e. Functions as a Service â€“ FaaS) and distributed computing principles targeting Internet of Things (IoT) applications.
          - Designed a system that enhances the power consumption of authentication and authorization for IOT devices by 60%
          - [Caplets](https://github.com/shereenElSayed/caplets_implementation) Implemented the [CAPLETs paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9709087) algorithm

          I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.
