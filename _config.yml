          My research focus area is <mark>distributed systems</mark> and <mark>IOT</mark>. I worked in several projects:
          - [CSPOT](https://github.com/MAYHEM-Lab/cspot): It is a runtime system that amalgamates "Serverless" computing (i.e. Functions as a Service â€“ FaaS) and distributed computing principles targeting Internet of Things (IoT) applications.
          - Designed a system that enhances the power consumption of authentication and authorization for IOT devices by 60%
          - [Caplets](https://github.com/shereenElSayed/caplets_implementation): Implemented the [CAPLETs paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9709087) algorithm

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
